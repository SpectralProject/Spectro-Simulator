# Spectro-Simulator
Simulator for my Spectro SoC.
Works as a terminal based VM which you can interface with directly. Or run as `spectrovm <riscv_program.elf>`. Which loads the `.elf` file and runs it sequentially.

## SpectroVM
Kind of like QEMU but instead you simulate only spectro hardware. Im not interested in other stuff, esp x86. If you want arm just use QEMU or a pi3/4.
